    "description": "On July 4, 2016, NASA’s Juno spacecraft entered Jupiter’s orbit to study the king of our solar system. But Jupiter is puny compared to some of the exotic exo-Jupiters found in our galaxy, likely to number in the billions. More than 1,400 light-years away floats Kepler-7b, a gas giant 50 percent larger than Jupiter, but half Jupiter’s mass. That means Kepler-7b has roughly the same density as Styrofoam. If you found a bathtub big enough, Kepler-7b could float. This monster is also 12 times hotter than Jupiter, placing it among the exoplanets known as “hot Jupiters.” It orbits its huge star so closely – in a scorching five days – that it is tidally locked like Earth's Moon. One side roasts by day, the other is permanetly plunged in darkness.\n\nKepler-7b was also the first exoplanet to have its clouds mapped, produced using data from NASA's Kepler and Spitzer telescopes. Its cloud map revealed weather patterns that can conduct superheated air from the roasting front of the planet to warm the side in endless freezing night. NASA’s Juno’s mission could also teach us more about hot Jupiters and the giants in our galaxy.",

    "description": " Kepler-22b is a super-Earth that could be covered in a super ocean. The jury is still out on Kepler-22b’s true nature; at 2.4 times Earth’s radius, it might even be gaseous. But theoretically an ocean world tipped on its side – a bit like our solar system’s ice giant, Uranus – turns out to be comfortably habitable based on recent computer modeling. Researchers found that an exoplanet in Earth’s size range, at a comparable distance from its sun and covered in water, could have an average surface temperature of about 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15.5 Celsius). Because of its radical tilt, its north and south poles would be alternately bathed in sunlight and darkness, for half a year each, as the planet circled its star. ",

The star's scorching heat is slowly stripping away and devouring the planet's atmosphere. In 10 million years, this alien world could be completely consumed.\n\nAlmost two times the size of our Jupiter, WASP-12b is a sizzling gas giant whose temperature is approximately 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2,210 degrees Celsius). Gravity causes enormous tidal forces which are streching the planet into the shape of an egg.",

    "description": "Kepler-452b is the first near-Earth-size world to be found in the habitable zone of star that is similar to our sun. Until its discovery in 2015, the Kepler telescope had only detected 12 Earth-size planets (smaller than twice the size of Earth) in the habitable zone of their smaller and cooler stars. Kepler-452b is the first planet orbiting a star about the same size and temperature as the sun.\n\nWhen looking for planets that might support life, scientists start with the habitable zone. The habitable zone is a region around a star where temperatures are right for water—an essential ingredient for life as we know it—to pool on the surface. Scientists don’t know if Kepler-452b can support life. What is known about the planet is that it is about 60 percent larger than Earth, placing it in a class of planets dubbed \"super-Earths,\" with an orbit of 385 days. Scientists believe that Kepler-452b is about 6 billion years old, much older than Earth.",
